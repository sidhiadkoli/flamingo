	Rhythm is one of the most important qualities of a writer. It's something that can take a long time to perfect and that can make a few simple sentences become animated in the minds of the reader. Rhythm is frequently utilized to create the perfect piece of text in terms of readability. 
	The central factor that creates rhythm is the length of your sentences. We're not talking about the average sentence length here, we're actually talking about the variation of the sentence length. If you vary your sentence lengths, you create the potential for rhythm. And now that you've got the potential, you just need to optimize and re-optimize until you find it. The affects of varying the length of a sentence depend on the intended audience.
